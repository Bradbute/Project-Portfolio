Welcome to my Project Portfolio. Please find the attached files related to a Machine Learning project completed for a predictive analysis course during my pursuit of an MBA. The attached files include the demonstration of the following ML skills:

- KNN
- SVM
- Neural Networks
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forests
  
The data for this project was sourced from an FAA study, available on Kaggle. All coding was done using the R language. I have included an Rmarkdown file, which serves as a link to the final output. For those unfamiliar with these files, please note that the HTML link represents the finished output, while the .RMD file contains the actual code.
